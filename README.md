# TekQ


Build something we like :)

TekQ (/'tekju:/) is an open-source organization founded by a few tech lovers to build something fun and cool. Tek stands for technology and Q for nothing but to lower the domain name price :(

You can come and see what we are building right now on [GitHub](https://github.com/tekqer) or subscribe to TekQ news via [RSS](https://tekq.cn/index.xml).
